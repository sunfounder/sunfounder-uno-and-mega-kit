Lesson 20 74HC595
=======================

Introduction
------------------

Generally, there are two ways to drive a single 7-segment display. One
way is to connect its 8 pins directly to eight ports on the Mega 2560
board, which we have done previously. Or you can connect the 74HC595 to
three ports of the Mega 2560board and then the 7-segment display to the
74HC595. In this experiment, we will use the latter. By this way, we can
save five ports – considering the Mega 2560 board’s limited ports, this
is very important. Now let's get started!

Experimental Principle
-------------------------

74HC595
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 74HC595 consists of an 8−bit shift register and a storage register
with three−state parallel outputs. It converts serial input into
parallel output so you can save IO ports of an MCU.

When MR (pin10) is high level and OE (pin13) is low level, data is input
in the rising edge of SHcp and goes to the memory register through the
rising edge of SHcp. If the two clocks are connected together, the shift
register is always one pulse earlier than the memory register. There is
a serial shift input pin (Ds), a serial output pin (Q) and an
asynchronous reset button (low level) in the memory register. The memory
register outputs a Bus with a parallel 8-bit and in three states. When
OE is enabled (low level), the data in memory register is output to the
bus.

**Pins of 74HC595 and their functions**:

**Q0-Q7**: 8-bit parallel data output pins, able to control 8 LEDs or 8
pins of 7-segment display directly.

**Q7’**: Series output pin, connected to DS of another 74HC595 to
connect multiple 74HC595s in series

**MR**: Reset pin, active at low level; here it is directly connected to
5V.

**SHcp**: Time sequence input of shift register. On the rising edge, the
data in shift register moves successively one bit, i.e. data in Q1 moves
to Q2, and so forth. While on the falling edge, the data in shift
register remain unchanged.

**STcp**: Time sequence input of storage register. On the rising edge,
data in the shift register moves into memory register.

**OE**: Output enable pin, active at low level. Here connected to GND.

**DS**: Serial data input pin

**VCC**: Positive supply voltage

**GND**: Ground

Principle
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the experiment MR (pin10) is connected to 5V (HIGH Level) and OE (pin
13) to GND (LOW Level). Therefore, the data is input into the rising
edge of SHcp and enters the memory register through the rising edge. We
use the shiftout() function to output a 8-bit data to the shift register
through DS. In the rising edge of the SHcp, the data in the shift
register moves successively one bit in one time, i.e. data in Q1 moves
to Q2, and so forth. In the rising edge of STcp, data in the shift
register moves into the memory register. All data will be moved to the
memory register after 8 times. Then the data in the memory register is
output to the bus (Q0-Q7). So the 16 characters are displayed in the
7-segment in turn.

**Step 2:** Open the code file.

**Step 3:** Select the **Board** and **Port.**

**Step 4:** Upload the sketch to the board.

You should now see the 7-segment display from 0 to 9 and A to F.

Code Analysis
----------------

**Code Analysis** **20-1** **Set the array elements**

.. image:: media_mega2560/image216.png
   :width: 6.77222in
   :height: 0.16389in

This array stores the data of the 16 characters from 0 to F. 252 stands
for 0, which you can calculate by yourself. To display 0, the segment g
(the middle one) of the 7-segment display must be low level (dim).

Since the segment g is connected to Q1 of the 74HC595, set both Q1 and
DP (the dot) as low level and leave the rest pins as high level.
Therefore, the values of Q7 Q6 Q5 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 are 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0.

Change the binary numbers into decimal ones:
1x2\ :sup:`7`\ +1x2\ :sup:`6`\ +1x2\ :sup:`5`\ +1x2\ :sup:`4`\ +1x2\ :sup:`3`\ +1x2\ :sup:`2`\ +0x2\ :sup:`1`\ +1x2\ :sup:`0`\ =252.

So that's the value for the number **0** to be displayed. You can
calculate other characters similarly.

**Code Analysis** **20-2** **Display 0-F in the 7-segment display**

.. code-block:: Arduino

    for(int num = 0; num < 16; num++)

    {

      digitalWrite(STcp,LOW); //ground ST_CP and hold low for as long as you are transmitting

      shiftOut(DS,SHcp,MSBFIRST,datArray[num]);

      //return the latch pin high to signal chip that it

      //no longer needs to listen for information

      digitalWrite(STcp,HIGH); //pull the ST_CPST_CP to save the data

      delay(1000); //wait for a second

    }

Set *STcp* as low level first and then high level. It will generate a
rising edge pulse of STcp.

**shiftOut()** is used to shift out a byte of data one bit at a time,
which means to shift a byte of data in *dataArray[num]* to the shifting
register with the DS pin. *MSBFIRST* means to move from high bits.

After *digitalWrite(STcp,HIGH)* is run, the STcp will be at the rising
edge. At this time, the data in the shift register will be moved to the
memory register.

A byte of data will be transferred into the memory register after 8
times. Then the data of memory register is output to the bus (Q0-Q7).
You will see a character is displayed on the 7-segment. Then delay for
1000ms. After that line, go back to *for()*. The loop repeats until all
the characters are displayed in the 7-segment display one by one after
16 times.
