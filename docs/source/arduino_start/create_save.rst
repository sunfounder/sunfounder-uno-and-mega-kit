How to create, open or Save the Sketch?
=======================================


#. When you open the Arduino IDE for the first time or create a new sketch, you will see a page like this, where the Arduino IDE creates a new file for you, which is called a "sketch".

    These sketch files have a regular temporary name, from which you can tell the date the file was created. ``sketch_oct14a.ino`` means October 14th first sketch, ``.ino`` is the file format of this sketch.

#. Now let's try to create a new sketch. Copy the following code into the Arduino IDE to replace the original code.


        .. image:: img/create1.png

    .. code-block:: C

        void setup() {
            // put your setup code here, to run once:
            pinMode(13,OUTPUT); 
        }

        void loop() {
            // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
            digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
            delay(500);
            digitalWrite(13,LOW);
            delay(500);
        }

#. Press ``Ctrl+S`` or click **File** -> **Save**. The Sketch is saved in: ``C:\Users\{your_user}\Documents\Arduino`` by default, you can rename it or find a new path to save it.

#. After successful saving, you will see that the name in the Arduino IDE has been updated.
